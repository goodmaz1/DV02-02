Dark Blue Box (TARDIS) - stationary target

Orange Dalek - Align (faces the same direction as the TARDIS - both look northeast, for example)

Red Dalek - Arrive & Look where going (Arrive is bugged as mentioned in DV02-01)

White Dalek - Face (Always looks at TARDIS)

Blue Dalek - Seek & Look where going 

Black Dalek - Flee from TARDIS & Look where going



NOTE: If daleks start flying away, reload tbe page - sometimes it works, sometimes not.
